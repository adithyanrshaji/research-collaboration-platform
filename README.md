# research-collaboration-platform
This is a platform for all researches that allows them to share their research papers, codes. Also, researchers having same area of interest or doing there their research in the same field could collaburate to continue their research as a team. On the other hand this platform also allows research organisationsations (like WRO) could access these research papers, add their own thoughts, suggest improvements.
